# PocketRemoveDuplicates
Python script which removes duplicated entries in Pocket list, originally written by Mierdin available [here](https://gist.github.com/Mierdin/0996952ba02d87175f3b). 
It uses Python wrrapper for Pyhon written by tapanpandita ([available here](https://github.com/tapanpandita/pocket))

I just put the files in one folder so that the script works out of the box, all you have to do is just provide Pocket consumer key.
